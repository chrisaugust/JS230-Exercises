          Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s 
          by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan. According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl,
          Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
          including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type
          system and automatic memory management.

        <p class="language-description">
          JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. 
          It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. 
          Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web 
          content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support 
          it without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, 
          making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, 
          and functional programming styles.

        <p class="language-description">
          Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
          Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

          Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
          including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
          It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

          Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language 
          and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. 
          Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. 
          Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.

          Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, 
          and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.
